## Project Values

### Optimize for accessibility at all levels

In all stages of the development process, thought should be taken to ensure the widest possible adoption by as many people as possible.

Anyone should feel comfortable running the software and its generated applications on their computers.  The installation process should be made as simple as possible, and all installed libraries should be reliably free of malware.

Command line tools should be general enough so that nontechnical people can complete simple tasks themselves.

User interface templates should be simple for designers to create and modify. Required data should be easy to mock out while waiting for a developer to implement live functionality.

Generated applications should function reliably and quickly on low-powered machines in the absolute worst conditions possible and allow users to perform the same tasks as in ideal conditions.
